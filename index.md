## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me2.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Welcome 
to 
my homepage. My name is Essi Heikkinen and I am a first-year student at University of Helsinki. I 
will probably major in Language Technology but I am very interested in Computer Science as well. 
My favorite hobby is travelling and I like doing programming projects a lot too. In fact, at 
the moment I am in Bangkok building this website which is quite an ideal combination for me.
